# daCPMMH_MALA

R code for two applications within the upcoming "Accelerating inference for stochastic kinetic models" paper

Code is for the aphid application (Section 5.2) and Lotka-Volterra application (Section 5.3).

Schemes used in the aphid application are contained in aphid_schemes.r

Data, tuning matrix and helper functions are contained in dataAphid.dat, sigtuneAphidBench.dat and aphid_helpers.r respectively (these are sourced in aphid_schemes.r)

Schemes used in the Lotka-Volterra application are contained in lv_schemes.r (To be uploaded!)

Data, tuning matrix and helper functions are contained in dataLV.dat, sigtuneLVBench.dat and lv_helpers.r respectively (these are sourced in lv_schemes.r) (To be uploaded!)

General helper functions used in both applications are contained in general_helpers.r (these are sourced in both aphid_schemes.r and lv_schemes.r)
